I forgot to message or ararange something, time passes and I feel arkward reaching out as it has been left for so long. the MVP of this is a web app that I cn list people, say how often I would like to speak to them, know the last date I did, and then then send me an email in x weeks/months time to remind me to reach out them, arange a coffee or lunch etc!

Taking a tangent from someone elses idea, but would allow Dept and X-gov networks to post themselves so there one site that list all the amazing networks and communityes in govemrent.

An addional benefit is that it could be used as part of recuitment to say "look at the amazing and varied networks the dept/CS have to offer"
